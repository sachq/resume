\noindent Dear Hiring Manager, \\

\noindent I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer position at Magic Eden. With over 10 years of progressive experience in full-stack development and a proven track record of building scalable web applications, I believe my skills align perfectly with your needs. 
\newline\newline
\noindent At Latcha \& Associates, I currently architect and lead development of enterprise-scale dealer marketing platforms that manage campaigns for over 4 million customers. I've successfully integrated complex systems while maintaining zero downtime and implemented robust CI/CD pipelines for daily deployments. My experience with Node.js, React, and TypeScript directly matches your technical requirements, and I've consistently delivered MVPs and rapid iterations in fast-paced environments.
\newline\newline
\noindent At CrowdANALYTIX, I built enterprise-scale platforms handling bulk image processing and AI model integration, processing millions of data points while maintaining sub-second response times. I've worked extensively with cloud infrastructure and modern web technologies, skills that would be valuable for Magic Eden's growing Web3 platform.
\newline\newline
I look forward to discussing how my technical expertise and leadership experience can help Magic Eden shape the next era of Web3.
\newline\newline
\noindent Best regards,\\
\noindent Sachin Thomas
